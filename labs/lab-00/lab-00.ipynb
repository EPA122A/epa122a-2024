    "The main bulk of the course relies on the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. Python is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) programming language widely used today. To give a couple of examples of its relevance, it is underlying [most of the Dropbox](https://www.quora.com/How-does-dropbox-use-python-What-features-are-implemented-in-it-any-tangentially-related-material?share=1) systems, but also heavily [used](https://www.python.org/about/success/usa/) to control satellites at NASA. A great deal of Science is also done in Python, from [research in astronomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLuIB8aW2KA) at UC Berkley, to [open-source courses in economics](https://quantecon.org/) by Nobel Prize Professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course uses Python because it has emerged as one of the main and most solid options for Data Science, together with other free alternatives such as R. Python is widely used for data processing and analysis both in academia and in industry. There is a vibrant and growing scientific community ([example](https://scipy.org/) and [example](https://pydata.org/)), working at both universities and companies, that supports and enhances its capabilities for data analysis by providing new and refining existing extensions (a.ka.a. libraries, see below). In the geospatial world, Python is also very widely adopted, being the selected language for scripting in both [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/software/arcgis) and [QGIS](https://qgis.org). All of this means that, whether you are thinking of continuing in Higher Education or trying to find a job in industry, Python will be an importan asset that employers will significantly value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a high-level language means that the code can be \"dynamically interpreted\", which means it is run on-the-fly without the need to be compiled. This is in contrast to \"low-level\" programming languages, which first need to be converted into machine code (i.e. compiled) before they can be run. With Python, one does not need to worry about compilation and can just write code, evaluate, fix it, re-evaluate it, etc. in a quick cycle, making it a very productive tool. The rest of this tutorial covers some of the basic elements of the language, from conventions like how to comment your code, to the basic data structures available.\n",

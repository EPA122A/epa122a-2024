By default, the `network_type` parameter value is 'all', meaning that we do not filter out paths that restrict certain types of traffic. This also means that one-way streets are honored as one-way and you cannot travel the wrong direction down them. Thus, the 500m takes into account only those nodes you can reach within 500m while only traveling in the allowed direction of the street. Instead (below), we can specify `network_type='walk'` to build a street network only of paths that walking is allowed on. This also makes every path bi-directional in the directed network, because you can walk in either direction on the sidewalk of a one-way street. Thus, the 500m now takes into account those nodes you can reach within 500m while traveling in either direction (even if it's a one-way street)."

    "\n",
    "Simplification is normally done by OSMnx automatically under the hood, but we can break it out to see how it works. OpenStreetMap nodes are weird. They include intersections, but they also include all the points along a single block where the street curves. The latter are not nodes in the graph theory sense, so we remove them algorithmically and consolidate the set of edges between \"true\" network nodes into a single edge. There are two simplification modes, strict and non-strict. The main difference is that unlike strict mode, non-strict mode allows simplification to an \"expansion graph\" (ie, if the graph were undirected, nodes with degree 2 as long as the incident edges have different OSM IDs). For a more in-depth demonstration of topological simplification with OSMnx, see [OSMnx examples](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)."

A *neighbor* of a given observation $i$ is another observation with which $i$ has some degree of connection. In terms of $W$, $i$ and $j$ are thus neighbors if $w_{ij} > 0$. Following this logic, the neighborhood of $i$ will be the set of observations in the system with which it has certain connection, or those observations with a weight greater than zero.\n",

    "Following this logic of more detailed weights through distance, there is a temptation to take it further and consider everyone else in the dataset as a neighbor whose weight will then get modulated by the distance effect shown above. However, although conceptually correct, this approach is not always the most computationally or practical one. Because of the nature of spatial weights matrices, particularly because of the fact their size is $N$ by $N$, they can grow substantially large. A way to cope with this problem is by making sure they remain fairly *sparse* (with many zeros). Sparsity is typically ensured in the case of contiguity or KNN by construction but, with inverse distance, it needs to be imposed as, otherwise, the matrix could be potentially entirely dense (no zero values other than the diagonal). In practical terms, what is usually done is to impose a distance threshold beyond which no weight is assigned and interaction is assumed to be non-existent. Beyond being computationally feasible and scalable, results from this approach usually do not differ much from a fully \"dense\" one as the additional information that is included from further observations is almost ignored due to the small weight they receive. In this context, a commonly used threshold, although not always best, is that which makes every observation to have at least one neighbor.\n",

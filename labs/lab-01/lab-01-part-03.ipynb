    "## Introduction to Web Servers and HTTP <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"section1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A web server is just a computer -- usually a powerful one, but ultimately it's just another computer -- that runs a long/continuous process that listens for requests on a pre-specified (Internet) _port_ on your computer. It responds to those requests via a protocol called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). HTTPS is the secure version. When we use a web browser and navigate to a web page, our browser is actually sending a request on our behalf to a specific web server. The browser request is essentially saying \"hey, please give me the web page contents\", and it's up to the browser to correctly render that raw content into a coherent manner, dependent on the format of the file. For example, HTML is one format, XML is another format, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally (and usually), the web server complies with the request and all is fine. As part of this communication exchange with web servers, the server also sends a status code.\n",
    "- If the code starts with a **2**, it means the request was successful.\n",
    "- If the code starts with a **4**, it means there was a client error (you, as the user, are the client). For example, ever receive a 404 File Not Found error because a web page doesn't exist? This is an example of a client error, because you are requesting a bogus item.\n",
    "- If the code starts with a **5**, it means there was a server error (often that your request was incorrectly formed).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Click here](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html) for a full list of status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analogy, you can think of a web server as being like a server at a restaurant; its goal is _serve_ you your requests. When you try to order something not on the menu (i.e., ask for a web page at a wrong location), the server says 'sorry, we don't have that' (i.e., 404, client error; your mistake).\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:**\n",
    "As humans, we visit pages in a sane, reasonable rate. However, as we start to scrape web pages with our computers, we will be sending requests with our code, and thus, we can make requests at an incredible rate. This is potentially dangerous because it's akin to going to a restaurant and bombarding the server(s) with thousands of food orders. Very often, the restaurant will ban you (i.e., Harvard's network gets banned from the website, and you are potentially held responsible in some capacity?). It is imperative to be responsible and careful. In fact, this act of flooding web pages with requests is the single-most popular, yet archiac, method for maliciously attacking websites / computers with Internet connections. In short, be respectful and careful with your decisions and code. It is better to err on the side of caution, which includes using the **``time.sleep()`` function** to pause your code's execution between subsequent requests. ``time.sleep(2)`` should be fine when making just a few dozen requests. Each site has its own rules, which are often visible via their site's ``robots.txt`` file.\n",
